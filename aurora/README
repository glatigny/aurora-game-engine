Aurora Game Engine README.

 1. Building the engine from scratch.

 1.1 Setting-up a new project :

Make a new empty folder with a Makefile.
Check out the aurora engine in a subfolder.
Copy aurora/mk/default_config.mk to aoe.mk.
Uncomment the last part of aoe.mk.
Include aoe.mk in your Makefile and add SRC += src/main.cpp and all other
C++ sources you need to compile.


 1.2 Building under Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 :

The only dependency is the OpenAL runtime. You must install OpenAL beforehand.
Check out win32 directory to your project folder AND to the aurora subfolder.
Run win32/make_run.cmd to compile and run your project. You may find other
useful tools in that folder (like the VCPROJ generator or make_mrproper.cmd to
clean autogenerated files).
Run make_eolclean.cmd from time to time to standardize EOL to unix text
format.


 1.3 Building under GNU/Linux :
Make sure that you have the correct development libraries installed on your
system.
Go to the top-level directory and do 'make run'.
